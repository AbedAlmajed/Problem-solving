# Problem-solving


This repository contains solutions to various data structures and algorithm problems implemented in JavaScript. The problems include reversing an array using a stack, implementing a queue using two stacks, finding the sum of an array using recursion, reversing a linked list, deleting the middle node in a linked list, and checking for balanced parentheses in an expression.
